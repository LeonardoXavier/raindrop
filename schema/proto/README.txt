These are the views for the protocol implementations.

Note that each protocol doesn't get its own design document - instead, the
design documents are structured such a ones likely to be used together are
grouped together, so they all get built at once.

For example, the 'seen' design document includes one view per protocol - the
expectation is in general, each protocol will need to process the same set of
"new" documents to determine what they need to fetch.
