			<h5><a name="principles">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h5>
			
			<dt>What is Raindrop? How does it work? Why does it exist?</dt>
			<dd><a href="about.html">Read more about it here</a></dd>
					
			<dt>Where can I get it?</dt>
			<dd>Check out the <a href="download.html">Download page.</a></dd>
			
			<dt>What is the timeline/roadmap for Raindrop?</dt>
			<dd>Raindrop is still a very young experiment. It has working code, but it is not in a state for normal users to use yet.
			It is a developer preview, and while we have <a href="about.html">specific design goals</a> for the project, we are looking for
			initial community feedback.</dd>
			
			<dt>Who is guiding Raindrop?</dt>
			<dd>The friendly folks at <a href="http://mozillamessaging.com">Mozilla Messaging</a>. We also work on <a href="http://mozillamessaging.com">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>.</dd>
	
			<dt>How does Raindrop relate to Mozilla Thunderbird?</dt>
			<dd>Thunderbird is useful today to millions of people, and is a great email client. There is a fresh and powerful version 3 of Thunderbird.
			Raindrop is an experiment that uses open web technologies to explore the broader messaging space. For instance, what would it mean to have
			a messaging experience that was usable both on your desktop and on your phone? Are there new types of interactions that a browser-based
			messaging application can provide? Some ideas that are explored in Raindrop may feed back into Thunderbird's active development.</dd>

			<dt>How does Raindrop relate to Google Wave?</dt>
			<dd>Google Wave is attempting to create a new form of messaging. We applaud their effort to innovate
			in the messaging space, and if it gains traction, we will be looking at ways to integrate the messaging protocols from
			Wave into the open, extensible user interface of the Raindrop platform. In the meantime, Raindrop is focusing on
			<a href="principles.html">complementing</a> existing messaging sources.</dd>

			<dt>I already use Gmail, and I think it is great! Why use Raindrop for my Gmail mail?</dt>
			<dd>Gmail has done an awesome job making email more usable. Raindrop would like to take it further by trying
			to break out of an email-centric view of messaging, and provide a user-extensible platform so users have complete freedom
			to customize their experience.</dd>
