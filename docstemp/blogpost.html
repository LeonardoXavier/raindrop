<h2>
Motivation
</h2>

<p>
The Internet has seen an explosion of innovation in messaging in the last few years, from Facebook and Twitter to Google Wave.  Email, on the other hand, has seen less innovation, in part because for most of us, email implies specific habits, interactions, and designs that we've adapted to over years.  While newer messaging services are often well-designed for the specific problems they aim to address, their interactions often don't integrate well with existing email workflows [ed. need better word], but instead simply use email as a notification mechanism that you have additional messages elsewhere that need to be dealt with separately.  Indeed, many non-messaging services such as auctions, bank statements, registrations, shipments use email similarly.  Add mailing lists to the mix, and it quickly becomes far too easy for important communications, both automated and personal, to get lost in the maelstrom.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, email still has qualities that newer systems haven't replicated: email communications can happen across a wide variety of interoperating systems; you can keep the same email address even when switching service providers; and interested individuals and organizations can own and control their own email data and infrastructure.  These are all things that the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto">Mozilla Manifesto</a> values, directly or indirectly.
<p>

<p>
We believe that messaging on the open web can combine the best of email and twitter, desktop, mobile and web interactions, and be a thriving source of useful, fun communications software. 
</p>

<h2>Raindrop</h2>
		  
<p>
Today, we're introducing a Mozilla Labs experiment called Raindrop to explore this space.  We've started particularly focussed on a few core values:

<ul>
  <li>Strong user experience and design ownership must lead the way.</li>
  <li>Fast, decentralized iteration is critical.</li>
  <li>It's important to work with on the right high-level concepts (e.g. people, conversations, and mailing lists; not just lists of messages).</li>
</ul>

<p>
These values are part of a larger <a href="principles.html">set of principles</a> that we believe will help us build software which is as useful, useable, and compelling as possible.
</p>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<p>
Raindrop hopes to be a product that collects conversations important to the user from existing sources on and off the web (email, blogs, social networks), not yet another messaging service of its own.  Over time, it should offer smart assistance organizing, prioritizing, and handling incoming information.  Elegance and simplicity are key design goals, to be achieved in part by focusing the core on a limited number of important use cases.  An important piece of Raindrop is to provide users with the tools to explicitly choose which parts of their data they wish to mashup with the Web and its services as well as which parts they wish to keep entirely private.

<h2>
The Development Platform
</h2>

<p>
While Raindrop's product-side has strong opinions about design, it also recognizes that design is an iterative process, and that it's important for users to be able to customize their experience.   To this end, Raindrop will offer developers a platform to extend and develop Raindrop built around the open web that supports easy, quick iteration using Bespin.   It will provide developers with a set of front-end widgets and back-end libraries that support important high-level concepts such as people, conversations, relationships, mailing lists, and todos.
</p>

<p>
From a technical perspective, Raindrop's platform is split into two pieces.  The back end contains message fetching, sending, and processing logic written in Python, a message store currently based on CouchDB, and REST APIs for use by front-end applications.  We intend to support multiple front ends of varying types, but our primary front-end is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is viewable from any modern browser (Firefox or Webkit-based).   One advantage of this architecture is that the front-end can be used from anywhere with a web-browser.  The backend is more flexible: users whose priority is complete control over their own data and offline use can run the message store components on their own computer alongside their browser.  Users whose priority is ease of use can choose to have their ISP manage their message store for them.

<h2>
Raindrop 0.1
</h2>

<p>
Today, we're releasing Raindrop 0.1.  While we have a vision and working code, many things are in the midst of being designed and implemented, and it's not yet ready for everyday use.  We're releasing 0.1 now because we want feedback on that vision, and because we'd like to invite the larger community of developers, designers, and users to join us in working on the prototype.
</p>

<p>
We expect Raindrop to evolve quickly and organically, incorporating feedback that we get along the way.  Important upcoming product feature work is likely to include features to help users quickly triage high volumes of incoming messages, along with a mobile client.  On the platform side, a bundled extension to allow users to contribute their usage data to the designers and developers, similar to Test Pilot, is a high priority, as is offering a server-side CommonJS environment so that writing backend extensions is accessible to a larger group of developers.  We also do not yet have a security model, and would welcome assistance in discussing and prototyping that.  <a href="https://intranet.mozillamessaging.com/wiki/Raindrop/Roadmap">Our evolving roadmap</a> has more details.

<h2>
Participation
</h2>

<p>
In our experience, different kinds of discussions tend to use different language, have different norms, and involve different sets of people.  One of the things that we're experimenting with as we prototype Raindrop is separating some of these discussions apart, in the hopes of keeping them more focussed.  We've set up several places for participation of various sorts:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>The raindrop-general community at GetSatisfaction centers around general discussion, support, and enhancement ideas.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/raindrop-core">raindrop-core Google Group</a> is for development discussion.</li>
  <li>The raindrop-design Flickr Group is for interaction and graphic design work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For chat, we'll be using the <a href="http://trunk.chat.mozillamessaging.com/thunderstorm/">Thunderstorm Jabber chat room</a> [ed. renamed to Raindrop before release].  Users of native clients such as Pidgin, iChat, etc will find us in the thunderstorm chat room on the conference.mozillamessaging.com server.  We hope to gateway it to an IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org in the near future.
</p>

<p>
We'll also be using the <tt>#raindrop</tt> hashtag on twitter.
