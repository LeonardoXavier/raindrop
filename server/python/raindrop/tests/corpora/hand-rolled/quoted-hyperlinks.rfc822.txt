Now to do something weird things.
here is a link to a wikipedia URL with parentheses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_(disambiguation) Then something within parentheses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_(magazine)), and then something that has a period on the end of it: http://python.org/about/index.html.

> this URL should not be picked up: http://example.com/quoted ok?

http://mozilla.com, These URLs should be picked up. Something with a comma in it, http://example.com/something/0,123,133.html, but do not get the last comma. And something on the end. http://bit.ly/HQFyP
