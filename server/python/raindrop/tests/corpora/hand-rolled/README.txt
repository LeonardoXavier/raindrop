This is a directory of 'hand rolled' documents - generally taken from real
raindrop installs, then hand-edited.

Particularly, the "to" and "from" etc lines have often been changed to one of
the 'test identities' used by the test suite, so we can trigger specific 
extensions.  Check out the 'raindrop' file also in this directory - it holds
the config used for this test corpus.

For documents without attachments, just adding a .json file is enough to
have it loaded into the corpus and run through the pipeline.  If the
document needs an attachment you will need two files - see the existing
docs for examples.
