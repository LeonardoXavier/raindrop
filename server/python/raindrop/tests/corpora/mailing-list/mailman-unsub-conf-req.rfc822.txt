Mailing list removal confirmation notice for mailing list test

We have received a request for the removal of your email address,
"mykmelez@example2.com" from the test@lists.example.com mailing list.  To
confirm that you want to be removed from this mailing list, simply
reply to this message, keeping the Subject: header intact.  Or visit
this web page:

    https://lists.example.com/confirm/test/018e404890076d94e6026d8333c887f8edd0c41f


Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a
message to test-request@lists.example.com:

    confirm 018e404890076d94e6026d8333c887f8edd0c41f

Note that simply sending a `reply' to this message should work from
most mail readers, since that usually leaves the Subject: line in the
right form (additional "Re:" text in the Subject: is okay).

If you do not wish to be removed from this list, please simply
disregard this message.  If you think you are being maliciously
removed from the list, or have any other questions, send them to
test-owner@lists.example.com.
