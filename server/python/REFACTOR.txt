Notes about what we need to refactor in the python backend:

Front-end visible changes:
--------------------------

* document['type'] should become a tuple of category, type; 
  document['raindrop_category'] should die.
  Better: consider a triple of ['raindrop', cat, type] - canonical test for
  'our' document becomes "doc['type'].length==3 && doc['type'][0]=='raindrop'"?
  XXX - may not be visible if only views are used???

* All type strings need rethinking - there was an early goal to have a kind 
  of 'sub-class' relationship (eg, "message" was a subclass of "message/raw")
  but that never eventuated.
  XXX - may not be visible if only views are used???

View-only visible changes:
--------------------------

These are changes which are only 'externally' visible as far as views; in 
other words, changes which are not externally visible if every view works as
expected...


Internally visible changes:
---------------------------

These changes don't affect the front-end.
