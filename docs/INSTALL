Installation Steps

Have Python 2.5 or later installed.

 If not 2.6: 
    install setup_tools
    easy_install simplejson

 Prereqs:
    easy_install couchdb (0.5 or later)

Install couchdb trunk.  This currently means you need to google for
instructions that work only on Linux - Windows doesn't work.  If you want to
work on Windows you must install Couch on a Linux box and point your windows
~/.raindrop file at the server.

Install twisted.

Install 'paisley' from launchpad.

Either install junius:
  cd junius/server/python/junius
  python setup.py develop
*or* just add it to your PYTHONPATH
  set PYTHONPATH=c:\src\path\to\junius\server\python

configure junuis:
  * edit ~/.raindrop

  * if your 'local' couchdb isn't on localhost, add a section along the lines of:
        [couch-local]
        host=hostname
        port=port

  * Add imap accounts along the lines of
        [account-some-account-name] # the 'account-' prefix is important!
        type=imap
        host=imap.gmail.com
        port=993
        username=username@gmail.com
        password=topsecret
        ssl=True
