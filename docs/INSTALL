Late Breaking News/Known Problems
=================================

* Error handling is poor.  I'm trying to get a handle on the best way to
  manage errors in a twisted environment before adding too much handling
  which may end up inappropriate.

Installation Steps
==================

Install Python 2.6 or later (note that Python 3 is not yet supported).

Install couchdb 0.9.  This currently means you need to google for
instructions that work only on Linux - Windows doesn't work.  If you want to
work on Windows you must install Couch on a Linux box and point your windows
~/.raindrop file at the server.  On Mac, you can use the MacPorts version.

Install Python setuptools.

Install the couchdb-python bindings (0.5 or later)
  easy_install couchdb 

Install twisted.

Install 'paisley' from launchpad.
  easy_install paisley

Either install raindrop:
  cd raindrop/server/python
  python setup.py develop
*or* just add it to your PYTHONPATH
  set PYTHONPATH=c:\src\path\to\raindrop\server\python

install modules required for 'protocols' - note that these are technically
optional - if the modules aren't installed a warning will be generated and
the protocol will simply be disabled

imap over SSL: PyOpenSSL (link?)

skype: Skype4Py (link?)
  easy_install Skype4Py

twitter: python-twitter (link?)
  easy_install python-twitter

configure raindrop:
  * edit ~/.raindrop

  * if your 'local' couchdb isn't on localhost, add a section along the lines
    of:
        [couch-local]
        host=hostname
        port=port

  * Add imap accounts along the lines of
        [account-some-account-name] # the 'account-' prefix is important!
        kind=imap
        host=imap.gmail.com
        port=993
        username=username@gmail.com
        password=topsecret
        ssl=True

  * Add a 'test' account - for the 'test suite' - along the lines of:
        [account-test]
        kind=test
        username=test # not used, but we die without it!
        num_test_docs=1 # this defaults to 5 - but 1 is useful sometimes!

** NOTE: if you edit this file, you must run 'run-raindrop.py install-accounts'
to get the new data into the raindrop database (the accounts are automatically
updated if the database is created, but we don't detect when the accounts
change)


With the couchdb server running....

Setup the database and upload views and other content:

  % run-raindrop.py

you should see output similar to:

  INFO:model:created new database
  INFO:raindrop.bootstrap:Adding account 'test'
  INFO:raindrop.bootstrap:client files are different - updating doc
  INFO:raindrop.bootstrap:design doc '_design/raindrop!accounts!all' has changed - updating
  ...
  Nothing left to do - terminating.  


Go to http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/index.html to check that the table(s) are 
setup

Test everything using the 'test suite' (one day it *will* be a test suite :)

  % run-raindrop.py -p test sync-messages process

  THEN repeat the above - sorry about that - the first run didn't quite
  do everything it was supposed to.

  % run-raindrop.py -p test sync-messages process

  Note the '-p' says to only load the 'test' protocol; without it we
  will attempt to load all protocols (eg, imap, skype, twitter, etc).
  But further note that we don't attempt a protocol - even the 'test' 
  protocol - until we have an account of that 'type' set up.

  Add '-l debug' to the above command-line for debug log messages.  This
  can get quite verbose; you can also say -l log.name=debug to set a specific
  log to debug.

  See --help for more.


Get *real* messages:

  % run-raindrop.py sync-messages
  % run-raindrop.py process

(reload http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/index.html to see stuff in the messages view)

Finally, go to http://127.0.0.1:5984/raindrop/files/rd_list/index.html to access
the Inflow application and other available applications.

You can edit any of the files in the 'schema' or 'client' directories, and
when run-raindrop is next started, the changes to these files will be detected
and they will be sent to the database.  We don't detect the changes while we
are running though, only at startup.

Unprocessing:

To delete all the intermediate messages in the DB, execute:

  % run-raindrop.py unprocess

The next time you execute a 'process' command, all your messages will be
processed from the start.


Error handling:

If there is an error during a 'process' operation (ie, an exception in the
converter), we will write an 'error document' and continue processing the
work queue.  We don't make a very loud noise at the end when this happens -
you need to notice it in the log output as it is running.  At any time you
can execute:

  % run-raindrop.py retry-errors

To re-process those messages - but this will generally result in exactly the
same error unless the converter has been fixed to deal with the condition
causing the error.  Alternatively, execute 'unprocess' to force reprocessing
of all messages, not only those which previously caused an error.
